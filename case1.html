        <b>Context:</b> Booking flights with American Airlines is tedious due to the amount of options available and the distracting content on the landing page that clutters the booking area with advertisements and unecessary popups.<br><br>
        I worked to create a more streamlined booking process for American Airlines travelers that minimized clutter and highlighted features that promoted booking travel easily.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="Design-Process">
        <p><b>Research</b><br>
            <b>Competitive Analysis:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>To begin, I compared the American Airlines landing page with that of it's competitor, Delta Airlines. I also reviewed Airbnb's website because although it exists in a different vertical of the travel industry, it is known for it's clean design and ease of use</li>
                <li>Market Research - include company logos here</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Target Audience/Persona</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Current users of the American Airlines website, as well as new users</li>
                <li>Have to ensure this design is easy to understand for new users wanting to book travel</li>
                <li>There cannot be a disconnect between the current website and the website I will be designing since users are accustomed to the current site</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Meet the User</b><br>
            -(picture of man here)-
            Name: Michael Smith
            Age: 26
            Occupation: Software Engineer
            Location: San Francisco, CA
            Marital Status: In Relationship<br>
            <b>Goals:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>He wishes booking was less tedious online</li>
                <li>He wants more ease in booking multiple flights since he often books for his partner as well</li>
                <li>He doesn't like the advertisements that are often not deals once he reads the fine print</li>
                <li>He wishes American Airlines had a map feature where he can choose airlines based on price like Google Flights does (some competitors also have this)</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Key Insights:</b><br>
            (icon)
            The most important components of flight booking to users are the price and the date/time factors. These should be made clear on the landing page.
            (icon)
            Users would like more flexible ways to explore dates and times of a variety of locations on this website.
            (icon)
            Users do not like distracting advertisements, especially when they are for very limited dates/times, or have other strings attached that are not practical for users booking travel.
            (icon)
            Most users book flights separately from hotels, so the focus here should be on the flight booking process.<br>
            <b>Define</b>
            <b>Problem Statement</b><br>
            The American Airlines landing page could benefit from better usability and cleaner design, in addition to less advertisements flashing at users during the booking process. It also lacks an efficient way to explore additional locations and dates/times for travel, and diverts the user's attention away from the primary focus of booking flights due to the amount of information and other calls to action on the landing page.<br>
            (<u>Note</u>: In this project scope, I did not include accessibility as American Airlines is dedicated to making their website experience accessible, and guarantees that their current site meet all current laws and guidelines – including the W3C WCAG 2.0 guidelines.)
            <b>Ideate</b>
            <p>I created some low fidelity wireframes to see how much I could remove from the AA experience while still allowing users to book travel.

                <br><br>
                <b>Key Takeaways:</b> With less content on the page and a greater focus on the booking area, users were able to book flights more quickly because they didn't need to spend time searching for where to book.

            </b><br>
            <b>Key Changes:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The AA login/signup box was removed from the center of the page and is still located in the top right hand corner for users to sign up with</li>
                <li>The scrolling advertisements were moved lower into the "Today's Offers" section of the site to keep them all together and to minimize user distraction while booking</li>
                <li>Removed the "redeem miles" option because this should appear in the checkout process where users can choose to purchase with cash/credit or redeem their miles</li>
                <li>I combined the "round trip" and "one way" options into an interactive toggle to save space and make it stand out more</li>
                <li>Consolidated the top navigation map to the three most important areas users would need to search for and moved the previous information elsewhere</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Iteration:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>After going through the wireframes and having users test them, I realized they were a cleaner version of the current AA landing page</li>
                <li>I wanted to create a transformed experience while still keeping booking travel with AA a top priority for users</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Final Wireframe & Prototype</h2>
            -Show the final product embedded in the page (inside a computer desktop frame), and then highlight the features you changed one by one
            <b>Changes Made</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Brightened up the website background to make it more inviting to travelers</li>
                <li>Simplified the booking experience to one bar in the middle of the page</li>
                <li>Reduced the amount of inputs users needed to enter when booking travel</li>
                <li>Provided the option to travel to a specific destination, along with the option for users to explore destinations</li>
            </ul>
    </div>
    <!--------End of Design Process------------>
    <b>Retrospective:</b><br>
    Changes I would make in the future to get more accurate results...
    <ul>
        <li>Increase the sample size of users interviewed</li>
        <li>Examine data from American Airlines to determine which features on the site need to be accentuated because they have business impact</li>
        <li>Get feedback from my final prototypes from a greater number of users</li>
        <li>Get data from AA on how users most frequently sign up for their loyalty program to see if this can take up reduced space on the landing page while still attracting new users</li>
